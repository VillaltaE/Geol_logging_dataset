# Geol_logging_dataset

## Introduction

I put into practice what I learned in the Statistics and Machine Learning training organized by Oracle Next Education and AluraLatam. 
I used data from a production oil well log from the public Kaggle database (https://lnkd.in/gk6XanEY).

Supervised learning techniques (linear regression) and unsupervised learning techniques (clustering) were used.

Data were added to the DataFrame based on available data, for example, VP from DTC, and VS derived from VP.

## Used libraries
